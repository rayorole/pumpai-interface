# Introduction

The purpose of this whitepaper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
technical and economic aspects of the PumpAI protocol. This document is intended
to be a living document and will be updated as the protocol evolves.

## What is PumpAI?

PumpAI is a decentralized protocol that enables the creation of tokenized assets.
The protocol is designed to be a decentralized and permissionless system that allows
anyone to create and manage assets. The protocol is built on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
and is designed to be compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Why PumpAI?

The PumpAI protocol is designed to solve the problem of creating and managing tokenized assets.
Most people are familiar with the concept of tokenized assets, but the process of creating and managing them requires
programming knowledge and more importantly, skill. The PumpAI protocol aims to solve this problem by providing a
simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and managing tokenized assets.

## Where does AI come in?

The PumpAI protocol uses AI to help users brand their assets.
OpenAI's GPT-4 is used to generate names and descriptions, but even more importantly, it is used to generate logos.

## How does it work?

All assets on the PumpAI protocol are represented by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
The smart contract contains all the information about the asset, including its name, description, and logo.
The smart contract also contains the logic for managing the asset, such as transferring ownership and updating the asset's information.

These smart contracts are programmed in Solidity, the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
All smart contracts on the PumpAI protocol are [open source](https://github.com/pump-ai) and can be viewed and verified by anyone.

Users can define the parameters of their asset, such as the name, description and more, all parameters will be used to compile the
smart contract, this will al be done in the browser using the [solc-js compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js?tab=readme-ov-file#solc-js).

Once the smart contract is compiled, the bytecode and Application Binary Interface (ABI) will be used to deploy the smart contract.
Users must sign the transaction using their EVM compatible wallet, such as Metamask. Once confirmed, the smart contract will be created.

The one who signs the transaction will be the owner of the asset, and can transfer ownership to another address.
So we (PumpAI) do not have any control over the assets, we only provide the tools necessary to create and manage them.

## Ecosystem

Once the final beta version is released, PumpAI will deploy its own $PUMPAI token, which will be used to govern the protocol.
The token will be used to vote on proposals.

For every asset created, the owner will receive $PUMPAI tokens, which will be used to vote on proposals.


## What is next?

We are currently working on the beta version of the protocol, which will be released soon.
Our team is working hard to make the protocol as user-friendly as possible.

Once the token creation process is complete, we will be working on supporting other blockchains, such as Tron and Optimism.
Eventually, you will also be able to deploy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the PumpAI protocol.

More information about the roadmap can be found on the [PumpAI docs](https://docs.pumpai.com/roadmap).


## Conclusion

The PumpAI protocol is designed to be a decentralized and permissionless system that allows anyone to create and manage assets.
The protocol is built on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is designed to be compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.

The PumpAI protocol uses AI to help users brand their assets.
OpenAI's GPT-4 is used to generate names and descriptions, but even more importantly, it is used to generate logos.
